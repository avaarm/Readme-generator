# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge - a colorful label, with meaningful info that is a link also 
* Project title 
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation - How to install it? npm package. 
* Usage 
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email

Refer to the [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md).

## Business Context

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

* The generated README includes the following sections: 
  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.
